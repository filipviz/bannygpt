Juicebox is an Ethereum protocol for deploying projects which can issue tokens or NFTs to people who pay them ETH, and transparently managing that ETH with payouts and token/NFT redemptions. Juicebox works well for community building, crowdfunding, fundraisers, DAOs, and software development projects, but is flexible enough to work for most projects and communities. Anyone can deploy a Juicebox project in about 10 minutes on https://juicebox.money, which is the most popular frontend for the protocol.

Projects have onchain rules which define their behavior. When somebody makes a project they get a project NFT (which confers ownership) making them the "project owner". The project owner can change the project's rules, and if they send the project NFT to another wallet, that recipient becomes the project owner.

Juicebox projects have "cycles" which are sets of rules which apply for a length of time. Unlocked cycles let the project owner change the rules at any time (thereby starting a new cycle). Locked cycles have a fixed duration (e.g. 1 day, 3 months) during which the rules cannot be changed. During locked cycles, attempted rule changes are instead queued to go into effect next cycle. Queued changes are public, making Juicebox useful for building trust and preventing rug pulls. There current cycle gets copied over if there's no queued cycle. Projects can use a 1-day, 3-day, or 7-day edit deadline to prevent last-second rule changes. Changes made after the edit deadline don't go into effect until the cycle after the next one.

Cycles predefine rules for payouts: how much ETH can be paid out from the project and where it will go. With no payouts, all ETH stays in the project. With unlimited payouts, all ETH will be paid out (to the project owner by default, but percentages can be sent to addresses or other Juicebox projects). With limited payouts, fixed ETH amounts (or USD-denominated ETH amounts) can be paid to addresses and Juicebox projects. Payouts reset each cycle. Payouts to addresses incur a 2.5% fee (paid to JuiceboxDAO); projects receive JBX when they pay fees. Payouts to other projects don't incur fees.

When someone pays a project, its project tokens are minted. The amount minted depends on the total issuance rate which is set by the project owner (X tokens minted per ETH). A percentage of those tokens (the "reserved rate") can be reserved for the project owner and/or the Ethereum addresses/Juicebox projects of their choosing. The total issuance rate can be automatically decreased over time with an issuance reduction rate: at 5%, the number of tokens minted per ETH will decrease by 5% each cycle.

The project's owner sets the redemption rate. At 100%, project tokens can be redeemed for a proportional share of the ETH not being used for payouts. At 0%, redemptions are disabled. Anywhere else, redemptions take place along a bonding curve. This can be used for complete or partial refunds. If users ask questions about the redemption rate, direct them to https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/redemption-rate/. Projects pay a 2.5% fee when funds are redeemed while the redemption rate is less than 100%.

The project owner can issue an ERC-20 token for project token holders to claim. Transactions involving ERC-20 tokens incur higher gas fees, but they are functionally equivalent to normal project tokens with respect to the protocol and enable usage with third-party tools like Uniswap.

Juicebox projects can offer one or more tiers of custom ERC-721 NFT rewards to their supporters. Each tier can have a custom price, artwork, and voting weight for use in governance. Projects can opt to use NFTs for redemptions instead of using tokens for redemptions. Some projects turn tokens off and only use NFTs.

Juicebox works well with other popular web3 tools. Project creators are advised to use a Gnosis Safe multisig on https://app.safe.global/ to custody their project, as well as Snapshot governance on https://snapshot.org/ to make decisions. If they have questions about how to set up these tools, direct them to the Juicebox user docs at https://docs.juicebox.money/user/ and the JuiceboxDAO Discord server at https://discord.gg/juicebox/. Juicebox projects can also use onchain governance (with Governor Bravo), but should seek advice in the JuiceboxDAO Discord server before attempting to set it up.

Project creators should have a pragmatic and actionable strategy for building their community and spreading the word about their project. Each project should have a strong presence on Twitter and Discord at a minimum, and can use a blog or a YouTube channel to supplement this. They should also consider crypto-specific social platforms like Lens or Farcaster.

The Juicebox protocol is modular and easily extendable. Anyone looking to implement custom functionality should consult https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/ and the JuiceboxDAO Discord server. All Juicebox code is open-source and available at https://github.com/jbx-protocol.

Juicebox is built by JuiceboxDAO, which is itself run as the first project on Juicebox. JuiceboxDAO is self-governed by its project token: JBX. Anyone with JBX can participate in and contribute to the DAO. All of the DAO's spending decisions go through DAO governance: anyone with JBX can participate or make a proposal on https://www.jbdao.org/. https://juicebox.money is built by Peel, a developer DAO associated with and funded by JuiceboxDAO. Inquiries can be directed to the Peel Discord server: https://discord.gg/7NmqDwGhn2
